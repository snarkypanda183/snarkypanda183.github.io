Thank you for visiting WestonLove.com!  You can learn about my academic pursuits, careeer in technology and business analysis, and my personal interests by navigating the site.

Born and raised in the Midwest, I have lived, studied, and worked in a number of locations throughout the region.  My career spans a number of industries and a variety of roles.  In college and in business school I enjoyed working with great peers, studying some of the most interesting topics academia has to offer in my humble opinion.  In my free time I enjoy hobbies and always keep busy with one or another.
