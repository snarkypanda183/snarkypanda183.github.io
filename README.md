I generated this website with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
The theme is comprehensive yet simple and easy to work with.  Check it out!

My GitHub Pages website contains information about my background and experiences in life, education, and work.  

Most content pages are based in the 'splash' layout from 'Minimal Mistakes'.
