Thank you for visiting WestonLove.com  You can learn about my academic pursuits, my careeer in technology and business analysis, and my personal interests.

Born and raised in the Midwest, I have lived, studied, and worked in a number of cities throughout the region.  My career spans multiple industries and a variety of roles.  In college and business school I enjoyed working with many great peers, studying some of the most interesting topics academia has to offer.  In my free time I enjoy many hobbies and always keep busy with one or another.
